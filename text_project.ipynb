    "- One document may belong to many classes in this problem, i.e., it's a multi-label classification problem. In fact there are documents that don't belong to any class, and you should also be able to handle these correctly. Pay careful attention to how you design the outputs of the network (e.g., what activation to use) and what loss function should be used.\n",
    "- You may use word-embeddings to get better results. For example, you were already using a smaller version of the GloVE  embeddings in exercise 4. Do note that these embeddings take a lot of memory. \n",
    "- In the exercises we used e.g., `torchvision.datasets.MNIST` to handle the loading of the data in suitable batches. Here, you need to handle the dataloading yourself.  The easiest way is probably to create a custom `Dataset`. [See for example here for a tutorial](https://github.com/utkuozbulak/pytorch-custom-dataset-examples)."

      "India must allow free imports and exports of gold and liberalise trade in the yellow metal to boost industrial and employment growth, senior government officials said on Saturday. \"The major objective of the new gold policy should perhaps be to recognise the importance of gold in the Indian economic system...,\" Y.V. Reddy, deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), told a gold seminar in the Indian capital. \"...(The policy) should enable gold to play a transparent and positive role in the industrial development, employment and export sectors of the economy,\" Reddy said. Reddy said India should allow free imports and exports of gold and give up its present system of trade through designated agencies. Currently state-run State Bank of India and MMTC Ltd are the only entities permitted to import gold. \"Free import under open general licence and free exports are pre-conditions for capturing world markets,\" Reddy said. He said most South Asian nations had liberalised gold imports, charging nominal duties. \"This development makes it imperative that we review our policies urgently.\" India is the world's largest consumer of gold, although nearly a third of its 900 million people live below the poverty line with the average per-capita income at around $330 a year. The country's annual consumption of gold is estimated at around 500 tonnes, 80 percent of it imported. India's main demand is for gold jewellery, given and used at an estimated 10 million weddings each year, which absorbs nearly 300 tonnes of the metal annually, bullion dealers say. P.P. Prabhu, the highest-ranking civil servant in the Commerce Ministry, told the seminar organised by the World Gold Council that much progress had been made in liberalising gold trade since 1991 when India launched an ambitious economic reforms programme. \"(But) of course the regime is still not very open,\" Prabhu added. He said smuggled gold currently accounted for only about 100-120 tonnes per year after India allowed non-resident Indians to bring in up to five kgs of gold each time they come to the country, subject to a certain duty. The limit was raised to 10 kgs in 1997. \"There is a significant reduction compared to early days when the percentage of smuggled gold was estimated to be more than 50 percent of the total consumption,\" Prabhu added. He said India's exports of gold jewellery had doubled since 1992/93 but there was still great potential for raising the country's share in the world jewellery trade. \"Although this sector has shown consistent growth, still, the potential is very much more especially considering the reservoir of talented craftsmen in India,\" Prabhu said. He said India's exports of gold and silver jewellery were worth $600 million annually against world trade of about $20 billion. India was considering ways to promote gold jewellery exports by allowing more agencies to import, stock and sell gold in domestic markets, Prabhu said. He said the RBI had already laid down guidelines for nominating more banks to import and sell gold and soon a number of new agencies would be permitted to import gold.\n",
