    "- One document may belong to many classes in this problem, i.e., it's a multi-label classification problem. In fact there are documents that don't belong to any class, and you should also be able to handle these correctly. Pay careful attention to how you design the outputs of the network (e.g., what activation to use) and what loss function should be used.\n",
    "- You may use word-embeddings to get better results. For example, you were already using a smaller version of the GloVE  embeddings in exercise 4. Do note that these embeddings take a lot of memory. \n",
    "- In the exercises we used e.g., `torchvision.datasets.MNIST` to handle the loading of the data in suitable batches. Here, you need to handle the dataloading yourself.  The easiest way is probably to create a custom `Dataset`. [See for example here for a tutorial](https://github.com/utkuozbulak/pytorch-custom-dataset-examples)."

      "Typhoon Winnie kills 25 in Taiwan. A typhoon that packed high winds and torrential rain killed 25 people in Taiwan on Monday and Tuesday, with landslides bringing down buildings and floodwaters turning streets into rivers, officials said on Tuesday. The death toll has risen to 25, one missing, 16 seriously injured and 62 slightly hurt, the government's anti-typhoon centre said in a statement. Three houses totally collapsed and 37 partly collapsed, it said. State television showed several five-storey buildings in eastern Taipei that had sunk two stories into the ground. The Central Weather Bureau said late on Monday the danger had passed as Typhoon Winnie headed towards mainland China. Heavy torrential rain and strong winds triggered landslides in Taipei, destroying or damaging buildings and blocking traffic. \"The whole scene looks as if it has gone through an explosion,\" a state television reporter in the city said. Local authorities mobilised hundreds of rescue workers and soldiers to help evacuate residents, but several people remained trapped in their houses, state media said. Seven people were buried after landslides hit their house in north Taipei. Only one woman survived. Torrential rain swamped houses in low-lying areas of the capital. Many roads were flooded and scores of vehicles submerged. The typhoon, packing maximum sustained winds of 144 km per hour (89 miles per hour) and gusts of up to 180 kph (112 mph), forced government agencies, financial markets and schools to close on Monday. All domestic flights were cancelled but most international flights were running to schedule. Many roads in mountainous areas were impassable. Some 68,500 households suffered power cuts, officials said. All government offices, markets and schools and most of the island's traffic systems returned to normal operations on Tuesday, officials said.\n",
